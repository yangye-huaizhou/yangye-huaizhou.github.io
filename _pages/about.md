**<font size=5>Ye YANG</font>** graduated from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS) in 2022, and was awarded Ph.D. degree under the co-supervision of both the ICT, CAS (advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~gaogang)) and Sorbonne University (advised by [Prof. Serge Fdida](https://www-npa.lip6.fr/~sf/), in France).  

After graduation, he joined Luoshen Cloud Network Department of Alibaba Cloud to engage in R&D for virtual network architecture and also commit to the academic research. During the period of 2022-2024, he conducted research on "high-performance vSwitch for large-scale cloud networks" at the joint postdoctoral workstation of Alibaba and Zhejiang University. His research areas include software defined networks, network virtualization, software-hardware co-design, etc. He is actively seeking cooperation with the academic community to solve real problems in the production environments.
